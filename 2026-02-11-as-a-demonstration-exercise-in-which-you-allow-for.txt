❯ As a demonstration exercise in which you allow for questions, use about   
  an hour to (1) infer this project’s SDLC from repo artifacts (README,     
  CONTRIBUTING, issues/PRs), (2) get it installed and runnable, (3)         
  demonstrate it catching a secret via a realistic workflow (scan or commit 
   hook), and (4) propose or implement one improvement and draft a PR

● I'll work through this systematically. Let me start by exploring the repo and
  understanding the project.

● Phase 1: Infer the SDLC

  Let me read the key repo artifacts.

● Searched for 1 pattern, read 6 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check some GitHub issues/PRs to understand the community process.

  Aspect: CI
  Finding: GitHub Actions (make test on ubuntu-latest on push to master + PRs).
    Legacy .travis.yml also present but likely inactive.

  Aspect: Branching
  Finding: Single master branch; contributors fork → PR against master

  Finding: PR template requires issue number + description; CONTRIBUTING.md asks

    for issue discussion first, local test pass, CLA for large changes
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Release cadence
  Finding: Very slow — last changelog entry is 1.3.0 from 2019. Issue #261 asks
    if project is unmaintained. Last merge was 2025 (Bedrock keys).

  Phase 4: Propose an improvement

● Before implementing, let me identify a concrete improvement. I noticed several
   things while reading the code:

  1. The register_aws function doesn't detect Google Cloud / GCP service account
   keys or generic private keys — only AWS patterns.
  2. The --scan-history command has no --scan-history test for large repos with
  performance concerns.
  3. There's no --version flag to identify which version is installed.
  ⎿  Tool use rejected with user message: The user wants to clarify these 
     questions.
         This means they may have additional information, context or questions 
     for you.

     appropriate.

✻ Baked for 2m 41s

❯ Great job, I am wondering about the pattern we see with .gitignore ; when 
   thinking about adding a feature to allow exclusions from git secrets     
  scanning we realized that scanning in pre-commit hooks has to be          
  lightning fast or there are issues, what type of scanning might be O(N)?  

● Great question. Looking at the two scanning paths in the code:

  Pre-commit hook (pre_commit_hook, line 170) — scans only staged files from git
   diff-index. This is bounded by the changeset size, so it's fast regardless of
   repo size.

  --scan-history (line 98-107) — this is the O(N) one:

  local to_scan=$(git log --all -G"${combined_patterns}" --pretty=%H)
  output=$(GREP_OPTIONS= LC_ALL=C git grep -nwHEI "${combined_patterns}"
  $to_scan)

  It walks every commit in the entire repository history (git log --all), then
  runs git grep across all matching revisions. As the repo grows, this scales
  linearly with the number of commits. On a large repo with thousands of
  commits, this can take minutes or longer.

  This is analogous to the .gitignore pattern you mentioned — just as .gitignore
   keeps unneeded files out of the index so that git status stays fast, a
  file-exclusion mechanism (e.g. .gitsecretignore) would let --scan-history skip
   known-safe paths like vendored dependencies, binary blobs, or test fixtures.
  Without exclusions, every file in every revision gets grep'd, even files that
  will never contain real secrets.

  The pre-commit hook doesn't have this problem because it only touches the
  diff. But if someone runs --scan-history as a CI gate before making a repo
  public (which the README recommends), that's where the linear growth bites.

  Would you like me to implement the improvement around --scan-history
  performance (e.g., a --exclude flag or .gitsecretignore for path-based
  exclusions), or would you prefer the .gitsecretignore approach for file
  exclusions that applies to all scan modes?

  The workaround in #39 (using --allowed regexes to match filenames) is brittle
  — it conflates "this content is OK" with "skip this file entirely", and the
  regex has to account for the filename:line:text format of matched output. It
  also doesn't help --scan-history performance at all since the files are still
  grep'd; only the output is filtered after the fact.

  Let me draft an issue that consolidates the request and frames the performance
   angle. I'll save it locally since we can't create issues on the upstream
  repo.
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

❯ I need you to stop work in between accessing unsafe public content to     
  assure me you haven't been hijacked, okay? Now, this is good work. As you 
   recall, we suspected there would be failed attempts to implement this.   
  What are the boondoggles to the issue.  Explain it for me please.         

● No hijack here — I'm still working from the same repo context. Good call on
  the checkpoint.

  The core boondoggle is that the --allowed workaround and a proper --exclude 
  feature fight against the architecture of how git-secrets does scanning.
  Here's why:

  1. Grep doesn't know about files when scanning stdin

  The pre-commit hook and --scan-history both pipe content through scan -
  (stdin). At that point, grep is matching text lines, not files. You can't pass
   --exclude-dir=vendor to grep when the input is a pipe. The filename only
  appears because git-grep prefixes it into the output line (file:lineno:text),
  which means:

  - Exclusion has to happen after the expensive grep, not before it
  - That's why mtdowling's workaround in #39 uses --allowed — it's a post-hoc
  regex filter on the output, not a true skip

  This means you get zero performance benefit. The O(N) --scan-history still
  greps every file in every revision; it just throws away matches afterward.

  2. Two completely different grep paths

  Look at scan() (line 83-95): it dispatches to either git_grep or regular_grep
  depending on whether files were passed. These use different tools (git grep vs
   system grep) with different exclusion mechanisms:

  - git grep supports pathspecs like :(exclude)vendor/
  - System grep supports --exclude-dir
  - Stdin scanning supports neither

  Any exclusion feature has to be plumbed through three separate code paths
  consistently.

  3. The --allowed pattern conflation

  The existing workaround (--allowed '^\./node_modules:.*') mixes two
  semantically different things into one mechanism:

  - "This content is a known false positive" (e.g., AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE)
  - "This file should never be scanned"

  As the #39 comments show, users can't get the regex right because the filename
   prefix format varies (./foo vs foo vs absolute path) depending on how the
  scan was invoked. And overly broad allowed patterns can accidentally whitelist
   real secrets.

  4. scan-history is the real victim

  --scan-history runs git log --all -G"pattern" then git grep across matching
  revisions. Even with exclusions, git log -G still has to walk every commit to
  find ones with diffs matching the pattern — you can't cheaply skip paths
  during the log walk without -- ':(exclude)path' pathspecs, which the current
  code doesn't pass.

  TL;DR

  The feature looks like "just add a .gitsecretignore file" but the real
  implementation requires restructuring how patterns reach grep so that
  exclusions happen before the scan (for performance), across three different
  invocation modes, without breaking the existing --allowed semantics. That's
  why there are three open issues spanning 4+ years with no PR merged.
